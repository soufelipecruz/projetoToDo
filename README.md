Hi guys!
Welcome to my HTML and CSS evolution project. I am developing some projects to develop myself in the HTML and CSS markup and styling languages, and in the JavaScript programming language.
This project is basically a To Do list, which is used to list things to be done where it is possible to add and remove tasks, in addition to marking them as completed.
I hope you like the project and have fun!
